# ðŸ¤– AI Usage Report

## AI Tools Used

- **Primary tools:**
  - **Claude AI** â€“ Used to refine and structure the initial task description into a clear prompt for Bolt.new
  - **Bolt.new** â€“ Generated the initial project scaffold with Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui setup
  - **Cursor AI** â€“ Main tool used in *Agent Mode* to implement all UI, layout, chart, and table changes with screenshot-based prompts and code preview
  - **ChatGPT** â€“ Used to write and polish this AI Usage Report and provide guidance on project structure and documentation

- **Key use cases:**
  - Translating the high-level project brief into clear prompts (Claude AI)
  - Full project setup and base component generation (Bolt.new)
  - Building all core features â€” metric cards, interactive charts, data table, animations, and enhancements â€” entirely through Cursor AI
  - Final documentation support via ChatGPT

## Sample Prompts

1. "Create an overview dashboard page with 4 metric cards using Tailwind and shadcn/ui"
2. "Add responsive Recharts components with loading skeletons and dark mode support"
3. "Implement a data table with sorting, filtering, and pagination using TanStack Table"

## AI vs Manual Work Split

- **AI-generated (~90â€“95%)**
  - Complete UI development (layout, sidebar, navbar, cards, charts, tables)
  - Component logic, styling, animations, and real-time simulation
  - Project scaffolding and dependency setup
  - Documentation files (`README.md`, this report)

- **Manual coding (~5â€“10%)**
  - Prompt crafting and refinement across Claude, Bolt, and Cursor AI
  - Minimal fine-tuning and responsiveness testing
  - Git management and deployment steps

- **Customization:**
  - Most outputs were adapted directly through Cursorâ€™s Agent Mode
  - UI changes were iteratively applied using screenshot-based instructions
  - Manual involvement was limited to guiding AI effectively and validating results
